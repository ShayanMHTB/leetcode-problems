'''
  You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. 
  The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. 
  Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
  You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

  Example:
    Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
    Output: [7,0,8]
    Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
